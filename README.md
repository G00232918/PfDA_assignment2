### Problem statement

This project will investigate the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The following list presents the requirements of the project:
- Undertake an analysis/review of the dataset and present an overview and background.
- Provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset and compare their performance
- Present a statistical analysis of the dataset
- Using a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset (using SKLearn etc.) and present classification performance results. Detail your rationale for the parameter selections you made while training the classifiers.
- Compare, contrast and critique your results with reference to the literature
- Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended â€“ using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints
- Document your work in a Jupyter notebook. 
- As a suggestion, you could use Pandas, Seaborn, SKLearn, etc. to perform your analysis. 
- Please use GitHub to demonstrate research, progress and consistency

### 1. Overview and background

- The dataset summary.

### 2. Review of Classifiers and Performance
- Read in the csv file and se the headers to have shorter names.
- Check is there any null values.
- Show the first 10 rows to ensure the data is correct.
- Check the last 10 rows.
- Check the datatypes.
- Describe to tranpose the data.
